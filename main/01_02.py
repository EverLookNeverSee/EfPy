    Knowing the difference between bytes and str

        there are two types that represent sequences of character data: bytes and str.
        Instances of bytes contain raw, unsigned 8-bit values (often displayed in the
        ASCII encoding). Instances of str contain Unicode code points that represent
        textual characters from human languages.
